            Icollator Forever is a web-based rewrite of <a href="http://www.the-vardemans.net/andrew/software">Icollator</a>,
            a small tool for combining multiple Windows .ico files into one.  This is useful if you are still interested in the archaic task
            of generating .ico files that look good at limited bit depths or if you're just really into the .ico format and want to know all
            the nitty gritty details of what's in your files.  By now there are plenty of other tools that will generate icons at all the
            appropriate sizes for multiple platforms and purposes from a single high-quality image.  So maybe Icollator Forever is more about
            me experimenting with new technology than it is about you doing something useful.

            Icollator Forever is built using Blazor, a cool new/upcoming technology from Microsoft that allows developers to write C# code
            and run it within the browser using a version of the Mono runtime that has been compiled to WebAssembly.  It's all pretty weird
            stuff, and you probably don't care.  One cool thing it means for you is that your images never leave your computer.  Everything
            is running client side, so once you've waited for the enormous web application to load, you don't have to upload files to a
            web server that does the image processing.  It's all happening on your computer.

            Icollator Forever is open source, and it depends on other open source software, in particular
            <a href="https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp">ImageSharp</a> from <a href="https://sixlabors.com/">SixLabors</a>.
            And I guess it uses Twitter Bootstrap, though I don't know any further details because I just built it on whatever came
            with Microsoft's Blazor sample app.  It may use <a href="https://github.com/secana/PeNet">PeNet</a> someday soon.
